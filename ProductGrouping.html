    <h1>Product Grouping for Supply Chain Cost Reduction</h1>
    <p>🚀 Want to Slash Your Supply Chain Costs? Start by Clustering Your Products! 📦📊</p>
    <p>Not all products are created equal &mdash; and your supply chain shouldn&rsquo;t treat them that way.</p>
    <p>✅ High runners </p><p>✅ Seasonal SKUs </p><p>✅ Slow movers </p><p>✅ High-margin products </p><p>✅ Perishables</p>
    <p>Each has unique demand patterns, service levels, and cost implications. By clustering products based on key attributes like demand variability, lead time, and margin, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🔍 Tailor inventory strategies</li>
        <li>📦 Group products with similar handling/storage needs</li>
        <li>🚛 Optimize replenishment & logistics</li>
        <li>💰 Unlock 10&ndash;25% in total supply chain cost savings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, you read that right &mdash; real-world applications of K-Means clustering + supply chain cost modeling have shown double-digit savings through smarter aggregation of safety stock,
        <p> better batch ordering, and efficient network planning.Whether you’re using K-Means, PCA, or just thoughtful segmentation — product clustering is the secret weapon behind agile, cost-effective supply chains.
</p>
        
    <p>📈 Here is the simulated product portfolios and the cost reduction compared to "one-size-fits-all" policies was game-changing.</p>
    <p>If you're still applying the same supply chain rules to every SKU &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to rethink.</p>
    <p>🧠 Smarter product grouping = Leaner, faster, and more resilient supply chains.</p>
