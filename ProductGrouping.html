    <h1>üì¶ Supply Chain Cost Optimization through Product Grouping</h1>

    <p>üöÄ Want to Slash Your Supply Chain Costs? Start by Clustering Your Products! üì¶üìä</p>
    <p>Not all products are created equal &mdash; and your supply chain shouldn&rsquo;t treat them that way.</p>
    <p>‚úÖ High runners </p><p>‚úÖ Seasonal SKUs </p><p>‚úÖ Slow movers </p><p>‚úÖ High-margin products </p><p>‚úÖ Perishables</p>
    <p>Each has unique demand patterns, service levels, and cost implications. By clustering products based on key attributes like demand variability, lead time, and margin, you can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>üîç Tailor inventory strategies</li>
        <li>üì¶ Group products with similar handling/storage needs</li>
        <li>üöõ Optimize replenishment & logistics</li>
        <li>üí∞ Unlock 10&ndash;25% in total supply chain cost savings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Yes, you read that right &mdash; real-world applications of K-Means clustering + supply chain cost modeling have shown double-digit savings through smarter aggregation of safety stock,
        <p> better batch ordering, and efficient network planning.Whether you‚Äôre using K-Means, PCA, or just thoughtful segmentation ‚Äî product clustering is the secret weapon behind agile, cost-effective supply chains.
</p>
        
    <p>üìà Here is the simulated product portfolios and the cost reduction compared to "one-size-fits-all" policies was game-changing.</p>
    <p>If you're still applying the same supply chain rules to every SKU &mdash; it&rsquo;s time to rethink.</p>
    <p>üß† Smarter product grouping = Leaner, faster, and more resilient supply chains.</p>

    <div class="section">
        
        <p>
            In modern supply chain management, <strong>product segmentation</strong> plays a crucial role in balancing service levels,
            minimizing inventory costs, and improving responsiveness. Businesses often manage a portfolio of products with widely
            varying characteristics ‚Äî such as demand patterns, holding costs, service levels, and lead times ‚Äî which pose a challenge for unified planning.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Python model demonstrates how <strong>product grouping using KMeans clustering</strong> can help <strong>optimize total supply chain cost</strong> 
            by pooling variability, consolidating order planning, and aligning service levels within homogeneous groups.
        </p>
        <p>
            By simulating cost components (ordering, holding, and stockout) across different levels of grouping (varying cluster count \( k \)),
            the model identifies the cost impact of segmentation strategies. It also highlights how <strong>data-driven clustering</strong> 
            can lead to more strategic product planning decisions.
        </p>
    </div>
   <h2>üìò 1. Approach and Simulation Process</h2>

    <p><strong>Step 1: Product Portfolio Definition</strong><br>
    The simulation begins by defining a diverse portfolio of 10 products, each with specific supply chain attributes including average demand, demand variability (standard deviation), lead time, ordering cost, holding cost, unit cost, and service level. This diversity reflects real-world differences in product behavior and cost impact within the supply chain.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 2: Feature Selection and Standardization</strong><br>
    Key features relevant to supply chain planning‚Äîsuch as demand statistics, lead time, and cost parameters‚Äîare selected to drive the grouping logic. These features are standardized using z-score normalization to ensure fair comparison across different scales and units.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 3: Dimensionality Reduction using PCA</strong><br>
    To aid in clustering and visualization, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to the standardized data. This reduces the dimensionality to two principal components while retaining most of the variance. It simplifies the clustering process and enables clear 2D visualization of product groupings.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 4: Clustering via KMeans Algorithm</strong><br>
    KMeans clustering is performed on the PCA-transformed data with varying values of <i>k</i>, representing different numbers of clusters. This helps to identify natural groupings of products that exhibit similar supply chain behaviors, allowing exploration of how grouping granularity affects total cost.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 5: Group Parameter Aggregation</strong><br>
    For each group (cluster) identified, aggregated parameters are calculated. The total demand is summed across products, while holding cost is computed as the demand-weighted average. The pooled demand variability is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared standard deviations. The group‚Äôs service level is also computed as a demand-weighted average of the individual service levels.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 6: Cost Component Calculation</strong><br>
    Using the aggregated values, the Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is calculated for each group using the formula:  
    \( Q = \sqrt{\frac{2DS}{H_{\text{avg}}}} \)<br>
    where \( D \) is total group demand, \( S \) is ordering cost, and \( H_{\text{avg}} \) is the average holding cost. Safety stock is computed as:  
    \( SS = z \cdot \sigma_{\text{pooled}} \cdot \sqrt{LT_{\max}} \)<br>
    where \( z \) is the Z-score corresponding to the group service level, \( \sigma_{\text{pooled}} \) is the aggregated standard deviation, and \( LT_{\max} \) is the maximum lead time in the group.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 7: Total Cost Estimation</strong><br>
    The total cost for each group includes:<br>
    - <strong>Ordering Cost</strong>: \( \text{Number of Orders} \times S \)<br>
    - <strong>Holding Cost</strong>: \( \left(\frac{Q}{2} + SS\right) \times H_{\text{avg}} \)<br>
    - <strong>Stockout Cost</strong>:  
    \( (1 - SL_{\text{group}}) \cdot C_{\text{avg}} \cdot D \)<br>
    where \( SL_{\text{group}} \) is the group service level, \( C_{\text{avg}} \) is average unit cost, and \( D \) is total demand.</p>

    <p><strong>Step 8: Scenario Comparison and Visualization</strong><br>
    For each value of \( k \), the total grouped cost is calculated by summing the costs of all clusters. These values are compared against the ungrouped scenario (each product treated individually). A line plot is generated to show how total supply chain cost varies with the number of product groups, helping identify cost-efficient grouping strategies.</p>

    <h2>üìä Impact of Grouping on Cost Components</h2>

    <p><strong>üßæ Ordering Cost ‚Üì (Decreases)</strong><br>
        Grouping products leads to demand aggregation, which increases EOQ and reduces the number of orders. As a result, total ordering cost decreases significantly. This is the most consistently reduced cost across all grouping scenarios due to economies of scale.
    </p>

    <p><strong>üè¨ Holding Cost ‚Üï (Mixed Impact)</strong><br>
        While grouping increases the average inventory (due to higher EOQ), it reduces safety stock requirements via risk pooling. Depending on the spread in demand and lead time within the group, the net effect can be neutral or a slight reduction.
    </p>

    <p><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Stockout Cost ‚Üï (Slight Increase Possible)</strong><br>
        In grouping, the service level is computed as a demand-weighted average of individual product SLs. If high-criticality products are grouped with lower SL products, the effective group SL may reduce slightly. This can increase expected stockout cost modestly.
    </p>

    <p><strong>üí° Summary</strong><br>
        Overall, grouping products can effectively reduce supply chain cost, primarily driven by reductions in ordering cost. Holding and stockout costs may stay the same or slightly change, depending on group composition. A balance between cost efficiency and service level alignment is crucial.
