Product Grouping with PCA and K-mean

🚀 Want to Slash Your Supply Chain Costs? Start by Clustering Your Products! 📦📊

Not all products are created equal — and your supply chain shouldn’t treat them that way.

✅ High runners
✅ Seasonal SKUs
✅ Slow movers
✅ High-margin products
✅ Perishables

Each has unique demand patterns, service levels, and cost implications. By clustering products based on key attributes like demand variability, lead time, and margin, you can:

🔍 Tailor inventory strategies
📦 Group products with similar handling/storage needs
🚛 Optimize replenishment & logistics
💰 Unlock 10–25% in total supply chain cost savings

Yes, you read that right — real-world applications of K-Means clustering + supply chain cost modeling have shown double-digit savings through smarter aggregation of safety stock, better batch ordering, and efficient network planning.

📈 Here is the simulated product portfolios and the cost reduction compared to "one-size-fits-all" policies was game-changing.

If you're still applying the same supply chain rules to every SKU — it’s time to rethink.

🧠 Smarter product grouping = Leaner, faster, and more resilient supply chains.
